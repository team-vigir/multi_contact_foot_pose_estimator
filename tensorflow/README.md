The library "lib_multi_contact_point_model.so"
is a library to load a tensorflow model file, hold it in a session and make predictions using the tensorflow core.
(See here how to build the shared library https://github.com/janpmetz/foot_pose_estimator/tree/master/cpp_tensorflow_run_model_lib)

The model "frozen_model_three_points.pb":
is a model file that holds the learned weights and the computation graph of the neural network.

The code to train the model and compile the library is here:
